# Editorial

This is the theme repo for my publication Musing Press. It is based on the Editorial ghost theme, a news-oriented design built around a dynamic 'locking' sidebar (try the toggle to see it in action!) and purpose built for content-centric sites. Originally created by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) and later ported to [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
